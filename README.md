Async Await 
===========

This repository and deck are part of the presentation, "Async/Await Explained." 

## 01Threads

Demonstration of creating a simple thread.

## 02ManyTasksNoThreadPool

Compute-bound workers using direct threads (no Thread Pool).

## 03ManyThreadsThreadPhool

Compute-bound workers using the Thread Pool. 

## 04Tasks 

Managing compute-bound workers using Task. 

## 05Parallel

Using the Parallel class to process compute-bound tasks.

## 06Asynchronous

Performing asynchronous I/O. 

## 07AsyncAwait

Using async/await keywords to work with asynchronous I/O. Also contains an example of a re-entrant method using iterators to demonstrate the concept of a "re-entrant thread."

## 07bAsyncAwaitWithContext 

WPF app demonstrating how async/await is different when a synchronization context exists.

## 08NoAsyncAwait

Using Wait() instead of await.

## 09AsyncThreadPool 

Comparison of performing multiple asynchronous I/O operations using threads vs. the Thread Pool.
